# Nand2Tetris - Building a Computer from Scratch

## Overview

**Nand2Tetris** teaches you how computers work from the ground up. You start with a single `NAND` gate and progressively build real hardware components, an assembler, a virtual machine, a compiler, and a simple operating system — all from scratch.

Each project builds on the previous one and reinforces core computer science concepts like logic design, computer architecture, low-level programming, and systems design.

## Project Overview

### **Project 1: Logic Gates**
Design basic logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, etc.) using only the primitive `NAND` gate. Forms the building blocks of all digital logic.

### **Project 2: Boolean Arithmetic**
Build arithmetic circuits like adders and an ALU to perform computation using binary logic.

### **Project 3: Memory**
Construct memory components such as registers and RAM using flip-flops and multiplexers.

### **Project 4: Machine Language**
Write programs in Hack assembly language to manipulate memory, perform control flow, and interface with hardware.

### **Project 5: Computer Architecture**
Build the Hack computer by integrating the CPU, memory, and ROM. Executes `.hack` binary programs.

### **Project 6: Assembler**
Write a program to translate Hack assembly code into machine-readable binary instructions.

### **Project 7: Virtual Machine I (Stack Arithmetic)**
Implement the first part of the Hack VM, translating stack-based commands into assembly.

### **Project 8: Virtual Machine II (Program Control & Memory Access)**
Extend the VM translator to handle branching, function calls, and memory segments.

### **Project 9: High-Level Language (Jack)**
Write programs in the Hack programming language and test the high-level VM on real apps.

### **Project 10: Compiler I (Syntax Analysis)**
Build a tokenizer and parser for Jack programs to generate intermediate representations.

### **Project 11: Compiler II (Code Generation)**
Translate Jack programs into VM code via syntax trees and code generation rules.

### **Project 12: Operating System**
Implement core OS libraries in Jack to support I/O, memory allocation, strings, and arithmetic operations.

## Project Status

So far, I’ve completed Projects 1 through 5, which cover everything from building logic gates to assembling a fully functional Hack computer. These stages involved constructing basic components like the ALU, memory units, and the CPU.

Project 6 (The Assembler) is currently in progress - I’m writing a tool to convert Hack assembly code into binary machine instructions.

The remaining projects, 7 to 12, are still ahead. These include building a virtual machine, writing a high-level compiler, and implementing an operating system — all in Jack, a custom language designed for this course.
